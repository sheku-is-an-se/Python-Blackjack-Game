Methods:(DECK CLASS)
__init__(self): The __init__ method to create the deck. The function needs to create all 52 cards and put them into the cards attribute.
shuffle(self): A function of randomly rearranging the deck cards.
deal_card(self): A function to discard and return the top card on the deck.
cards_left(self): A function to return how many cards are left in the deck.
